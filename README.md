ðŸ“… Leap Year Checker in C
Description

A beginner-friendly C program that determines whether a given year is a leap year. It uses conditional statements (if-else) to apply the rules of leap years:

Divisible by 100 but not 400 â†’ not a leap year

Divisible by 4 but not 100 â†’ leap year

Not divisible by 4 â†’ not a leap year

This program is perfect for learning decision-making structures in C and understanding real-world logic implementation.

How It Works
